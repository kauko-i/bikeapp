        <h1>Solita Dev Academy pre-assignment</h1>
        <p>Hello from the world of a Solita applicant!</p>
        <p>I think I've accomplished all the recommended and additional stuff suggested in the assignment described <a href="https://github.com/solita/dev-academy-2022-fall-exercise">here</a>, except pagination and searching on the station list. Extra features not included. See the views from the links above to test the app.</p>
